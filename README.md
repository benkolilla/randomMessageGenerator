## General info
The goal of this project is to generate random messages and practice using GitHub, markdown and creating my first README.md file. 
As the first step, it generates random insiprational messages.

## Technologies
- Node.js

## Sources
This project is inspired by codecademy full stack developer course. 

## Improvement plan
In further versions new categories will be added: 
- GYM motivation
- Jokes

## **Steps**

1. In an object, creat 3 arrays with different motivational messages
2. Loop through the arrays and push one message from every array to finalMessage
4. Format output message, return the whole message (.join()) in a 'quotation mark'
3. Create a function that can add new messages to an array
4. extra step: Create boolean to chose from different categories
    1. Add one more category following similar steps
    2. Boolean choses category based on the selected one (stored in a variable - will handle user input later)
    3. CHANGE MOTIVATIONAL MESSAGES TO JOKES!!
